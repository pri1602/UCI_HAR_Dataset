SUMMARY: The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person
performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration
and 3-axial angular velocity measurements were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randoml
y partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then a 561-feature vector with time
and frequency domain variables is captured.
For the purpose of this assignment, the 'mean' and standard deviation' variables out of all the 561 feature vector variables are extracted.
Then the mean of each of these variables, grouped by each subject and each activity is computed. The dataset presented here therefore 
consists of a total of 81 time and frequency domain variables, summarized for each of the 6 activities and each of the 30 subjecta.

DATA PROCESSING: The files used are available at [UCI-HAR](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
The files used for this project are:
- X_test.txt  : dataset with the test subjects' observations.
- X_train.txt : dataset with the training subjects' observations. 
- y_test.txt  : dataset with the activity codes for test dataset.
- y_train.txt : dataset with the activity codes for the training dataset. 
- activity_labels.txt : dataset corresponding to activity labels for y_test and y_train. 
- features.txt : dataset with the names for each feature. Used as variable names.
- subject_test.txt : dataset with subjectIDs for the test dataset. 
- subject_train.txt : dataset with subjectIDs for the training dataset.
Please refer to the corresponding README.MD file for details of how the data was processed.
