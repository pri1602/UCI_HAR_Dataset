SUMMARY: The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person
performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity measurements were captured
at a constant rate of 50Hz.The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then
a 561-feature vector with time(with the prefix 't')and frequency(with the prefix 'f') domain variables is captured.The time domain 
signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth
filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity 
acceleration signals (e.g.tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and 
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, 
tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these 
signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag.'XYZ' is used to
denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the
training data and 30% the test data. 

For the purpose of this assignment, the 'mean' and standard deviation' variables out of all the 561 feature vector variables 
are extracted. Then the mean of each of these variables, grouped by each subject and each activity is computed. The dataset presented
here therefore consists of a total of 81 time and frequency domain variables, summarized for each of the 6 activities
and each of the 30 subjects.
