SUMMARY: The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person
performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration
and 3-axial angular velocity measurements were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randoml
y partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then a 561-feature vector with time
and frequency domain variables is captured.
For the purpose of this assignment, the 'mean' and standard deviation' variables out of all the 561 feature vector variables are extracted.
Then the mean of each of these variables, grouped by each subject and each activity is computed. The dataset presented here therefore 
consists of a total of 81 time and frequency domain variables, summarized for each of the 6 activities and each of the 30 subjects.
